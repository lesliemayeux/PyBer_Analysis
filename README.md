# PyBer_Analysis
Using Python to visualize and analyze a data set around ridesharing.

## Overview of Analysis
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

- Rural cities have the fewest riders
- Urban cities have the highest demand for riders at 68.4% of total rides in the data
- Average ride cost are higher in rural areas compared to urban.

## Summary
There are more rides in urban areas most likely due to higher population and less in rural due to a smaller population.  The average rides in the rural areas are more due to distance of the rides and availability of drivers whereas in urban areas, people live closer to each other and the places they want to go.
